# Water level Controller Using Ultrasonic Sensor with ESP32
## Introduction
The "Water Level Controller Using Ultrasonic Sensor with ESP32" project aims to monitor and control the water level in a tank using an ultrasonic sensor, ESP32 microcontroller, LEDs for level indication, and a motor to manage the water flow. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the water surface, and based on the measured level, different LEDs are activated, and the motor is turned on or off accordingly.

## Components
1. ESP32 Microcontroller: The main control unit of the project.
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Used to measure the distance to the water surface.
3. 4 LEDs:
   * Low Level LED: Indicates a low water level.
   * Medium Level LED: Indicates a medium water level.
   * High Level LED: Indicates a high water level.
   * Motor Indicator LED: Represents the motor status.
4. Relay Module: Controls the motor based on the water level.
5. 4 Resistors: Current limiting for the LEDs.
